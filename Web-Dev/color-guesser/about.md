# Color Guesser

As the name implies it is a color guesser game. There is a div with a particular background color (say #1d1d1d) and there are 3 buttons with different colors written on them. Users can guess the background color of the div by clicking either of the 3 buttons mentioned above. If they have guessed correctly a message is displayed saying `Correct answer!!`. If they have made a wrong guess a message is displayed saying `Wrong answer`.

## Todo

The options to guess doesn't contain the background color which is generated. i.e. if the background color generated is `#0000ff` the generated options may contain `#fff`, `#111`, `#3c3c3c` and in the next render the generated options will contain `#0000ff`.
