# Event propogation

## Initial Setup

This webpage contains a signin which is similar to what you see on many websites.
But there is a catch. If you look at the script file `initial.js`, it has a function
by the name `signInWithUserNameAndPassword` which takes care of signing in except
that function is not being executed.

## Todo

Find out why the function `signInWithUserNameAndPassword` is not being executed even though it is added as submit event handler to the form and make necessary changes such that users can signin.
